		Fireflies synchronize their flashing during evenings when at a high enough density (>15 fireflies in an area); 
		however, not all fireflies flash at once. Instead they flash in staggered groups, creating the illusion of all of 
		them flashing at once. This website uses a mathematical equation to represent this synchronization. Click the 
		buttons on the side to interact with the visualization and change how the fireflies behave.
