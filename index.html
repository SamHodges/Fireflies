	<h1>Fireflies</h1>
	<p>
		Firefly synchronization has historically been completely misunderstood. Previously, researchers assumed fireflies had
		an internal lighting clock, and would synchronize according to that. Now, we understand fireflies are more random and relational than previously understood. A firefly will flash randomly sometime between every 12 seconds to a few minutes, with no internal rhythm. However, they also flash when neighbors do (for the most part). As fireflies respond to their neighbors, they become more closely aligned due to them flashing as soon as they are able.

	<ol>
		<li>First firefly flashes</li>
		<li>Neighbors usually flash if they can (some don't for unknown reasons), and don't if they're recharging</li>
		<li>As more fireflies enter the space, it becomes more and more likely one will flash as soon as it's recharged</li>
		<li>Neighbors continue to respond, producing sychronization!</li>
	</ol>
